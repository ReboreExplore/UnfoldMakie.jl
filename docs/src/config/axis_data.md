# [Axis Data](@id config_axis)

The axis data of the configuration consists of config options for the axis. 

The input of this config is directly fed into the `Axis` function of the `Makie` module. 
As a consequence, the possible options are also determined by the function. 
Details for these options can be found in the [corresponding article of the Makie documentation](https://makie.juliaplots.org/v0.17.13/examples/blocks/axis/index.html).
